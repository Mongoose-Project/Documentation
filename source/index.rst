Mongoose Engine
###############

Mongoose is an attempt to introduce python as scripting language for web development, displacing javascript.

Welcome to my journey of exploring, the world of web browsers and byte code virtual machines. 

At the time of starting this project I have very rudamentary knowledge of how Javascript engine works, and also very little about C++ programming. I am using chatGPT for the intial planning and guidance.

I am going to document the knowledge as I gain it and hopefully have a proper replacement of JS by one year.
